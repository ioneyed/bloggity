# Introduction

This version of Bloggity will be created using Spring and JPA. This will demonstrate the core functionality of the application utilizing the JPA ORM system. Hopefully this will show some streamlining of code by utilizing the JPA that users will see the power in doing POC's with JPA and CRUD Applications using it (as performance permits).

## Tech Used

Spring Boot
Thymeleaf (Render initial index page)
Spring Security
JPA
H2 Database (local database engine)
